I stumbled accross the name Jada in the sourcecode
--------------------------------------------------

Jana was originally named JaDa which stands for 
Java Dynamic analysis framework.

However, a tool with that name was already described 
in an IEEE publication. 
This tool also analyzes concurrent Java programs.

To prevent confusions, JaDa was renamed to Jana.
Jana stands for Java Analysis framework.

The new name is also more accurate, because cl-jana 
performs only static analyses to add calls to a 
run-time monitor into Java programs. 

Only a small part, namely the actual run-time monitor
is dedicated solely to the dynamic analysis of Java 
programs.
